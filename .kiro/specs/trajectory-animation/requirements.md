# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add trajectory animation capabilities to the Li cluster simulation system. Currently, the system generates .xyz trajectory files from molecular dynamics simulations but lacks the ability to create visual animations from these files. This feature will integrate animation generation using professional molecular visualization packages like OVITO, ASE, or py3Dmol to create smooth, high-quality animations of the Li cluster transformation process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to automatically generate animations from .xyz trajectory files, so that I can visualize the molecular dynamics simulation results in an intuitive way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .xyz trajectory file is generated by the LAMMPS simulation THEN the system SHALL automatically create an animation file
2. WHEN the animation generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download link for the animation file
3. IF the .xyz file contains multiple frames THEN the animation SHALL show smooth transitions between frames
4. WHEN generating animations THEN the system SHALL support common video formats (MP4, GIF, WebM)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to customize animation parameters, so that I can control the visual quality and style of the molecular animations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating animations THEN the user SHALL be able to select animation format (MP4, GIF, WebM)
2. WHEN generating animations THEN the user SHALL be able to set frame rate (10-60 FPS)
3. WHEN generating animations THEN the user SHALL be able to choose visualization style (space-filling, ball-stick, wireframe)
4. IF the user doesn't specify parameters THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults (MP4, 30 FPS, space-filling)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the animation generation to integrate seamlessly with the existing web interface, so that I can access animations without leaving the current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a simulation completes successfully THEN the web interface SHALL display an animation preview
2. WHEN the animation is ready THEN the interface SHALL show both .xyz download and animation download buttons
3. IF animation generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and still allow .xyz download
4. WHEN viewing animations THEN the interface SHALL provide playback controls (play, pause, speed adjustment)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the animation generation to be robust and handle various file sizes, so that the system remains stable under different usage scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large .xyz files THEN the system SHALL handle files up to 100MB without crashing
2. IF animation generation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback
3. WHEN multiple users request animations simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately
4. IF the animation generation process fails THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to use professional molecular visualization tools for animation generation, so that I can produce publication-quality results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating animations THEN the system SHALL support OVITO as the primary animation engine
2. IF OVITO is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to ASE-based animation generation
3. WHEN using OVITO THEN the system SHALL apply professional rendering settings (lighting, materials, camera angles)
4. WHEN generating animations THEN the system SHALL maintain atomic element colors consistent with the static visualizations
